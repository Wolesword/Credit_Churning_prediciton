# Credit Card Churning prediction

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Please find inside this repository a code which analyses the probability of a customer staying with the bank based on his details. 

Credit card churning is the practice of repeatedly opening new credit cards to earn sign-up bonuses and then typically stopping use of them. This is a real problem for banks and financial institutions. 

To mitigate this problem, please find below a machine learning solutions which identifies the probability of customer attrition.

Furthermore, some visualisations offer additional insight on the data presented and answer some of the questions below: 

* ðŸ¤” Does gender matter in credit churning?
* ðŸ¤” Which income category is most likely to leave?
* ðŸ¤” Does educational level influence attrition?
* ðŸ‘¯ and many more...

From the analysis, it can be seen that attrition is mostly observed with customers with reduced banking activity. Other features such as gender, educational level, marital status and dependents are not very significant to this attitude. However, middle age customers (from 35 to 55yrs) are most likely to engage in credit churning.

It is still a work in progress and open to suggestions.

Cheers. W
